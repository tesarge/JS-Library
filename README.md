# JS-Library

A book saving app using vanila JavaScript. In total, this project took me 23 hours. In this project I learned:

...How to work with local storage. It has been my first experience with client storage and was much less difficult than I expected

...How to create JS objects using event listeners and through client-side input. Subsequently, I strengthened my understanding of OOP through creating objects and displaying and removing them from the page. 

...How to take breaks and not get in over my head. As a self-taught developer, it's quite easy for me to want to rush into something new and complete it for the sake of saying I did it. With this project however, I took my time to ensure that I understood everything happening under the hood and allowed myself plenty of rest. My biggest break through on the app came at 5 AM after I decided to get to bed early the night before. In the 30 minutes after waking up, I was able to start on finish a large portion of the DOM manipulation. It just went to show me the importance of taking my eyes off code and letting the inspiration come to me without being in front of the computer.
